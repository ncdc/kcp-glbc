== Description

The source of the alert is the `up` metric. It fires when the prometheus target for the GLBC is failing to be scraped.
When this alert fires, it usually means the GLBC component is not running, metrics is misconfigured, or the metrics endpoint is not responding.

== Prerequisites

// Include the following steps in every alert SOP
* Access to the physical cluster where GLBC should be running

== Execute/Resolution

// Include this as the first step in every alert SOP
. Check the GLBC component & namespace for indications of problems.
+
[source,sh]
----
kubectl logs deployment/kcp-glbc-controller-manager
kubectl get events
----
. Based on logs or events you may need to kill the pod to get it into a good state again, or troubleshoot any errors (GLBC or K8S).
. If GBLC is running OK, check for metrics configuration issues.
+
[source,sh]
----
kubectl get podmonitors kcp-glbc-controller-manager -o yaml
----
. Verify the `podMetricsEndpoints` corresponds to a port on the GLBC pod.
. Verify the `selector` matches the GLBC pod.
. Check Prometheus Operator logs for any errors. The monitoring namespace may be different depending on the observability stack installed.
+
[source,sh]
----
kubectl logs deployment/prometheus-operator -n monitoring
----

== Validate

//Include the following steps in every alert SOP
. Check the alert is no longer firing.
